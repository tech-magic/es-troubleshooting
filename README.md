# Developing a PC Problem Troubleshooting Wizard using an Expert System Shell

## About the project

Here is how you can develop a PC Troubleshooting wizard (something like Troubleshooting in Windows Help documentation) using an expert system shell.

This implementation uses e2glite which is an expert system shell developed with java applet support (http://www.expertise2go.com/webesie/e2gdoc/e2gmod2.htm, http://www.expertise2go.com/webesie/e2gdoc/e2gmod4.htm).

The knowledge base is `troubleshoot.kb`.

For in-detail reference please refer to `Wimal_Perera_Artificial_Cognitive_Systems_Assignment.pdf`.

## Prerequisites

Java 1.5 or higher with any web browser supporting java applets.

## Running the Project

Open `troubleshoot.html` in the web browser with java applet support.
